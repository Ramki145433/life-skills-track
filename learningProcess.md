# Learning process 

There are six interactive components of the learning process: attention, memory, language, processing and organizing, graphomotor (writing) and higher order thinking. These processes interact not only with each other, but also with emotions, classroom climate, behavior, social skills, teachers and family.

### Their is a popular technique called "Feynman Technique" many people are using their leaning proces 

The Feynman Technique is the most effective method to unlock your potential and develop a deep understanding.

Richard Feynman was not only a Nobel laureate in Physics but also a master of demystifying complex topics. His key learning insight: complexity and jargon often mask a lack of understanding.

Feynman’s learning technique comprises four key steps:

### Step 1: Select a concept to learn.
What topic are you curious about?

Take out a blank sheet of paper. Write out everything you already know about the subject you want to understand deeper. As you learn more about the topic, add it to your sheet. If you use a different color pen as you learn new things, you can literally watch your knowledge grow.

Once you think you understand the topic well enough, move on to step 2.

### Step 2: Teach it to a child.
Can you explain your chosen concept to a 12-year-old? Test your understanding by simplifying your notes. Banish jargon and complexity, using only words a child would comprehend. Simplicity reveals a depth of understanding, while jargon often conceals ignorance. You want to give yours.

Anyone can make a subject complicated but only someone who understands can make it simple.

### Step 3: Review and Refine
Write down your simplified explanation. The act of writing aids reflection and learning. In fact, reflection is the most important part of the learning process. Reflection is how we learn what we know and what we need to learn.

Simple is beautiful.

Clear writing gives poor thinking nowhere to hide.

Ensure your notes are free of any jargon or something that sounds confusing. Ensure your notes are free from jargon or any glossed-over complexities. If something sounds confusing, it needs more refinement.

Read it out loud as if to a child. If the explanation isn’t simple enough or sounds confusing, that’s a good indication that you need to reflect and refine.

Go back to the source material, reviewing the parts you don’t quite understand yet.

Repeat until you have a simple explanation.

### Step 4: Organize and Review.
To test your understanding in the real world, present your explanation to someone else. How effective was your explanation? What questions did they ask? What parts did they get confused about?

When you’re happy with your understanding, take the page you created with a simple explanation and put it into a binder. Following this technique for everything you learn gives you a binder full of learning that you can review a couple of times a year.

## Different ways to implement this technique in your learning process.

The Feynman Technique can be implemented in various ways to enhance your learning process. Here are some different approaches you can take when applying the technique:

1. **Written Explanation**: Write down your explanation of the concept in simple and concise terms. Use plain language and avoid technical jargon. This approach helps solidify your understanding and allows you to review and refine your explanation.

2. **Teach Someone Else**: Imagine teaching the concept to someone else, such as a friend, family member, or even an imaginary student. Verbalize your explanation and ensure it is clear and understandable to the listener. Teaching someone else helps identify areas where you might struggle to convey the information effectively.

3. **Create Visual Aids**: Use visual aids like diagrams, flowcharts, or illustrations to support your explanation. Visual representations can enhance comprehension and help clarify complex relationships or processes.

4. **Record and Listen**: Record yourself explaining the concept and listen to the recording. This technique allows you to hear your explanation from an outside perspective, helping you identify areas that need improvement or further clarification.

5. **Simplify and Summarize**: Condense your explanation into a brief summary that captures the key points and fundamental ideas of the concept. This exercise forces you to distill the concept to its core components, aiding in better understanding and recall.

6. **Engage in Discussion or Q&A**: Engage in a discussion or participate in a question-and-answer session about the concept with peers or online communities. Actively participating in conversations helps solidify your understanding and exposes you to different perspectives and insights.

7. **Practice Application**: Apply the concept to practical examples or problem-solving exercises. By actively using the knowledge in different contexts, you deepen your understanding and identify areas that require further exploration.


## How to learn by Barbara Oakley:

### Use recall. 
After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little, and
never highlight anything you haven’t put in your mind first by recalling. Try recalling main ideas
when you are walking to class or in a different room from where you originally learned it. An ability
to recall—to generate the ideas from inside yourself—is one of the key indicators of good learning.

### Test yourself. 
On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.
## Chunk your problems. 
Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it
can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it
cold—every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind"The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything" is a TEDx talk by Josh Kaufman, an author and business expert. In this talk, Kaufman introduces the concept of rapid skill acquisition and shares a method for learning new skills efficiently.

Kaufman challenges the commonly held belief that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill, as popularized by Malcolm Gladwell's book "Outliers." He suggests that for most skills, it only takes around 20 hours of focused and deliberate practice to reach a level of proficiency.

He outlines a four-step process for learning any new skill effectively:

1. **Deconstruct the skill**: Break down the skill into its component parts and identify the most important elements to focus on initially. By understanding the key elements of the skill, you can prioritize your learning and practice efforts.

2. **Learn enough to self-correct**: Spend a small amount of time researching and gathering enough information to self-correct your mistakes. The goal is not to become an expert through extensive study, but to acquire the necessary knowledge to recognize and correct errors.

3. **Remove barriers to practice**: Eliminate distractions and create an environment conducive to practice. Designate dedicated time and establish a routine to ensure consistent and focused practice sessions.

4. **Practice for at least 20 hours**: Engage in deliberate practice for at least 20 hours. Break down the skill into manageable sub-skills and practice each sub-skill for a focused period of time. Kaufman emphasizes the importance of quantity over quality in the initial stages of skill acquisition.

Throughout the talk, Kaufman shares personal anecdotes and examples from his own experience in learning various skills, such as playing the ukulele and programming.

"The First 20 Hours: How to Learn Anything" provides a practical and encouraging framework for approaching skill acquisition. Kaufman's approach emphasizes the importance of focused practice, breaking down skills, and overcoming initial hurdles to achieve meaningful progress in a short period of time., so the
information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want.
### Space your repetition. 
Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an athlete.
Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.
### Alternate different problem‐solving techniques during your practice. 
Never practice too long at
any one session using only one problem‐solving technique—after a while, you are just mimicking
what you did on the previous problem. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This
teaches you both how and when to use a technique. (Books generally are not set up this way, so
you’ll need to do this on your own.) After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure
you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions. To study most effectively,
handwrite (don’t type) a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the other.
(Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing.) You might also photograph
the card if you want to load it into a study app on your smartphone. Quiz yourself randomly on
different types of problems. Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your book, pick out a
problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.
### Take breaks. 
It is common to be unable to solve problems or figure out concepts in math or science
the first time you encounter them. This is why a little study every day is much better than a lot of
studying all at once. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that
another part of your mind can take over and work in the background.
### Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies. 
Whenever you are struggling with a concept,
think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten‐year‐old could understand it? Using an analogy
really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water. Don’t just think your
explanation—say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effort of speaking and writing allows
you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning.
### Focus. 
Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a
timer for twenty‐five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty‐five minutes and try to work as
diligently as you can. After the timer goes off, give yourself a small, fun reward. A few of these
sessions in a day can really move your studies forward. Try to set up times and places where
studying—not glancing at your computer or phone—is just something you naturally do.
### Eat your frogs first. 
Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.
### Make a mental contrast. 
Imagine where you’ve come from and contrast that with the dream of
where your studies will take you. Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your
dream. Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both for you and
those you love!
