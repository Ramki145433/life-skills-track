# Sexual harrasment

### what is sexual harrasment :

is a type of harassment involving the use of explicit or implicit sexual overtones, including the unwelcome and inappropriate promises of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.[1] Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from verbal transgressions to sexual abuse or assault.[2] Harassment can occur in many different social settings such as the workplace, the home, school, or religious institutions. Harassers or victims may be of any sex or gender.[3]

In modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a "general civility code".[4] In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.

Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal employment discrimination. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.

## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can encompass a wide range of behaviors. The following are examples of behaviors that can cause sexual harassment:

### 1. Verbal Harassment: 
This includes making sexual comments, jokes, or innuendos, using explicit or offensive language, or engaging in sexually suggestive conversations.

### 2. Physical Harassment: 
Unwanted physical contact such as touching, groping, hugging, or kissing without consent constitutes physical sexual harassment. It also includes blocking someone's path, leering, or making sexual gestures.

### 3. Visual Harassment: 
Displaying or sharing sexually explicit material such as photos, videos, or written content without consent can create a hostile or offensive environment.

### 4. Quid Pro Quo Harassment: 
This occurs when someone in a position of power, such as a supervisor or manager, demands sexual favors in exchange for job benefits, promotions, or other advantages. It involves linking professional opportunities or outcomes to sexual compliance.

### 6. Hostile Work Environment: 
A work environment can be deemed hostile when there is a pervasive presence of offensive sexual conduct, comments, or behavior that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive atmosphere.

### 7. Retaliation: 
Taking adverse actions, such as threats, discrimination, or negative consequences, against someone who has reported or objected to sexual harassment is considered retaliation and is also prohibited.

It's important to note that these examples are not exhaustive, and sexual harassment can manifest in various forms. The key factor is that the behavior is unwanted, unwelcome, and creates a hostile or uncomfortable environment for the individual experiencing it. Laws and policies may vary by jurisdiction, but generally, they aim to protect individuals from such behaviors and provide avenues for reporting, seeking support, and taking appropriate action.


## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is important to take appropriate steps to address the situation and seek support. Here's a suggested course of action:

### 1. Ensure your safety: 
If you are in immediate danger or feel threatened, prioritize your safety. Remove yourself from the situation if possible, and seek assistance from authorities or security personnel if needed.

### 2. Document the incidents: 
Keep a record of the incidents, including dates, times, locations, descriptions of the behavior, and the names of any witnesses present. Documentation can be crucial if you decide to report the harassment later.

### 3. Talk to someone you trust: 
Reach out to a supportive friend, family member, or colleague who can provide guidance and emotional support. Discussing your experiences can help validate your feelings and provide you with perspective.

### 4. Review workplace or organizational policies: 
Familiarize yourself with the policies and procedures in place within your workplace or organization regarding sexual harassment. Understand the reporting process, available resources, and any relevant deadlines.

### 5. Report the incidents: 
If you feel comfortable and it is safe to do so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority within your organization. This could be your supervisor, human resources department, or a designated contact for handling such complaints. Follow the established reporting procedures and provide them with the documented information you have collected.

### 6. Seek professional support: 
Consider consulting with a legal professional, counselor, or therapist experienced in handling cases of sexual harassment. They can provide you with advice, guidance, and emotional support throughout the process.

### 7. Preserve evidence: 
If there is any physical evidence, such as emails, messages, or other forms of communication related to the harassment, preserve them. They can be helpful in supporting your case, should you choose to pursue legal action.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your well-being and make decisions that feel right for you. Each situation is unique, and you may choose different steps based on your comfort level and the specific circumstances. If you are unsure about the appropriate actions to take, consulting with a professional or seeking advice from a legal expert can provide you with tailored guidance based on your specific situation and jurisdiction.

## Prevention 

Sexual harassment and assault may be prevented by secondary school,college,and workplace education programs.At least one program for fraternity men produced "sustained behavioral change".

Many sororities and fraternities in the United States take preventive measures against hazing and hazing activities during the participants' pledging processes (which may often include sexual harassment). Many Greek organizations and universities nationwide have anti-hazing policies that explicitly recognize various acts and examples of hazing, and offer preventive measures for such situations.[full citation needed]

Anti-sexual harassment training programs have little evidence of effectiveness and "Some studies suggest that training may in fact backfire, reinforcing gendered stereotypes that place women at a disadvantage".

The use of audio and video recording can help in preventing sexual harassment in the workplace. Audio recording apps are available for use on smartphones, and can for instance be used during job interviews.

### India legal guidelines and definitions

Sexual harassment in India is termed "Eve teasing" and is described as: unwelcome sexual gesture or behaviour whether directly or indirectly as sexually colored remarks; physical contact and advances; showing pornography; a demand or request for sexual favours; any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct being sexual in nature or passing sexually offensive and unacceptable remarks. The critical factor is the unwelcomeness of the behaviour, thereby making the impact of such actions on the recipient more relevant rather than intent of the perpetrator. According to the Indian constitution, sexual harassment infringes the fundamental right of a woman to gender equality under Article 14 and her right to life and live with dignity under Article 21.

In 1997, the Supreme Court of India in a Public Interest Litigation defined sexual harassment at workplace, preventive measures and redress mechanism. The judgment is popularly known as Vishaka Judgment. In April 2013, India enacted its own law on sexual harassment in the workplace—The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. Almost 16 years after the Supreme Court's landmark guidelines on prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace (known as the "Vishaka Guidelines"), the Act has endorsed many of the guidelines, and is a step towards codifying gender equality. The Act is intended to include all women employees in its ambit, including those employed in the unorganized sector, as well as domestic workers. The Indian law does not permit the victim or complainant to take assistance of a legal professional in the inquiry, however, in Arti Devi Vs Jawaharlal Nehru University, the High Court of Delhi permitted the complainant to avail the services of a counsel as her defence assistant.

The Act has identified sexual harassment as a violation of the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India and her right to life and to live with dignity under article 21 of the Constitution; as well as the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business which includes a right to a safe environment free from sexual harassment. The Act also states that the protection against sexual harassment and the right to work with dignity are universally recognized human rights by international conventions and instruments such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which has been ratified on the 25th June, 1993 by the Government of India.[circular reference]

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 introduced changes to the Indian Penal Code, making sexual harassment an expressed offense under Section 354 A, which is punishable up to three years of imprisonment and or with fine. The Amendment also introduced new sections making acts like disrobing a woman without consent, stalking and sexual acts by person in authority an offense.
