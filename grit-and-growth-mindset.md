The concept of growth mindset was developed by psychologist Carol Dweck through her extensive research on achievement and success. In essence, a growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through dedication, effort, and continuous learning. This mindset contrasts with a fixed mindset, which assumes that talents and intelligence are fixed traits and cannot be changed.
